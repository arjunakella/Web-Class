    <h4>Zoo Box builds a new online system that strives to value farmers and customers equally</h4>
    <img src="images/farm.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Zoo Box" title="Zoo Box" width="1000"/>
    <br/>
    <p>
      In the U.S., six vertically-integrated brands control nearly all
      of the feeding, processing and distribution of livestock. To
      minimize costs, the farmers who work for these corporations
      frequently feed their animals corn and soy products,
      supplemented with growth hormones and antibiotics.
    </p>

    <p>
      “This is a very broken model,” said Catherine Compitello, the
      CEO of online startup Zoo Box. “It’s worthless to farmers, and
      it’s worthless to consumers.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Consumers have become skeptical of this corporate system and
      movements for grass-fed, pasture-raised meat sourced from local
      producers are growing across the nation. In response to
      increasing demand, Zoo Box has built a new system that strives
      to value farmers and customers equally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zoo Box buys pasture-raised, antibiotic and hormone-free cattle,
      pigs and poultry from a network of regional farms, then
      processes and sells the meat to wholesalers and individual
      consumers in the mainland US. Consumers can buy their meat
      through an e-commerce platform and get free delivery to their
      doorstep.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zoo Box is one of several recent agriculture and food-related
      startups founded by Chris Baggott, an online startup
      entrepreneur. Zoo Box has proven its concept since opening in
      2018, demonstrated by its partnerships with local farmers and
      meat processors and $1.2 million in revenue last year.
    </p>

    <h4>Augmenting Agriculture with Tech</h4>
    <p>
      Zoo Box started out as a one-farm operation run by Baggott in
      Greenfield, IN. When the company couldn’t meet demand with its
      single location, it began supplementing its own livestock with
      animals from a handful of other farms. Under the current
      arrangement, farmers take care of raising their own animals, and
      Zoo Box handles harvesting, storage and distribution with the
      help of a few business partners.

      Baggott and Compitello often meet with farmers in person to
      ensure they’re following all guidelines for raising
      livestock. But this kind of interaction doesn’t scale well,
      which is why the team is developing proprietary technology to
      maintain our high standards as we expand geographically.

      When complete, the technology will allow farmers to use their
      mobile devices to capture and send vital data about their
      animals, the food they eat and their pasture rotation. Zoo Box
      will be able to analyze the data to ensure compliance with our
      regulations and keep the entire network running smoothly.

      “In building this technology at scale, we’ll have brand
      integrity,” Compitello said. “We’ll have accountability with our
      farmers, consumers will have transparency, and Zoo Box can
      easily manage our system and guarantee our farmer contracts.”
    </p>

    <h4>The Struggle to Make Organic Economically Expedient</h4>

    <p>
      Zoo Box’s tech platform is great for managing our growing
      network, but getting farmers to sign up could be a persistent
      challenge. Only 3% of grass-fed beef consumed in the U.S. is
      produced in the U.S., partly because it’s much cheaper to feed
      cattle corn and soy.

      Zoo Box attracts farmers with promises of higher prices and a
      reliable market. The average commodity crop farmer earns $500
      per acre; by comparison, Zoo Box offers its producers $3,000 per
      acre. So far, these incentives have been relatively successful
      in attracting farm partners.

      But Compitello reported the company’s biggest obstacle is still
      finding more farmers to fill out its network. Supply continues
      to outpace demand, which proves their products are valuable to
      consumers. The company just has to ensure it remains valuable to
      farmers even as market conditions and government incentives
      might change.
    </p>

    <h4>Sowing a Revolution in Sustainable Meat Farming</h4>

    <p>
      Zoo Box’s small but lucrative customer base is the most
      promising sign of growth. It has 1,100 active customers who
      order 1-3 times per year and 500 loyal customers who order 1-3
      times per month. A lot of revenue is coming from a very small
      group of people.

      Considering the $43 billion domestic market for organic food
      that grows by double digits every year, there’s incredible
      potential for Zoo Box to scale nationally. It already has a
      competitive edge over other meat delivery services like
      ButcherBox and Greensbury thanks to its focus on creating local,
      sustainable farming networks that benefit producers as well as
      consumers.

      “We believe we’ve built a system that works very well,”
      Compitello said. “It gives farmers a stable market to sell into
      and customers a high-quality product that is always delivered
      directly to their doorstep.”
